This project is an implementation of a Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract
for the ext/mysql. It passes all unittests of the Zend_Db testsuite
for an adapter and should therefore be very robust.

The purpose for implementing an adapter for the deprecated ext/mysql
is the legacy application reason. A considerable share of people probably has
legacy applications that use mysql_* functions. You can inject this Zend
adapter into these applications wihtout having to use multiple db connections.

This adapter emulates prepared statements with positional characters ?.

Usage:

$db = new Whitewashing_Db_Adapter_Mysql($options);

To set or get the mysql Resource:

$mysql_conn = $db->getConnection();
$db->setConnectionResource($mysql_conn);
